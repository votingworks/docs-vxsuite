# Process Late Ballots

You may receive properly post-marked absentee ballots for five days after election day that need to be counted. To add these ballots to unofficial results:

1. Scan late-received ballots on VxCentralScan, preserving the election-night scans
2. Save the CVRs, including both election-night and late-received.
3. Load the new CVR file in VxAdmin
4. Print tally report
5. Save SEMS results
6. Upload results to SEMS

VotingWorks recommends scanning and tabulating all late-received ballots at once though you may process late-received ballots multiple times by repeating these steps.

## Scan Late-Received Ballots

When you turn on VxCentralScan, you should see previous batches scanned on election night. You can scan new batches for the properly postmarked ballots received after election night, using the normal scanning instructions, including adjudicating ballots that don't scan. See [Central Scanning](../election-ops/scanning-ballots.md).

## Save CVRs

After scanning all late-received ballots, save the combined CVR file that contains all ballots, both election-night and late-received. See instructions under [Tally Results](../election-ops/tabulating-results.md), the portion on exporting CVRs.

## Load CVRs

In VxAdmin, load the new CVR file. Select _`Load CVR Files`_.
