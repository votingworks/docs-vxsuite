# Setting Up and Opening Polls

There are two main pieces of equipment that you will set up at your polling place:

* **VxScan:** a scanner where voters will cast their ballots and precinct results will be tabulated
* **VxMark:** an accessible ballot-marking device (a.k.a. voting machine) where voters can vote on a touchscreen and print their ballot. The VxMark's connected printer will also be used to print polls open and polls closed reports

Use the following guides to set up the equipment before you open polls:

{% content-ref url="vxscan-setup.md" %}
[vxscan-setup.md](vxscan-setup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="vxmark.md" %}
[vxmark.md](vxmark.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Use the following guide when you want to open polls to allow voting to begin:

{% content-ref url="opening-polls.md" %}
[opening-polls.md](opening-polls.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
