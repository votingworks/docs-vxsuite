# VxScan Setup

## Hardware Overview

**VxScan** is in a tamper-evident blue container that may be rolled like a suitcase. Inside is an additional tamper-evident blue container used to store scanned ballots.

## VxScan Setup

The **VxScan** should be set up on its own table and the table should be located somewhere between the privacy booths and the exit to the polling place.\
\

**VxScan** can be set up through the following steps:

1.  **Open the container:**

    * [ ] break the seal and record the seal number in the **Equipment Seals Log**
    * [ ] unzip the top compartment

* [ ] plug it into a white outlet in back of the power backup
* [ ] plug the power backup into an outlet

* [ ] open the front flap and secure it to the velcro at the bottom of the container
