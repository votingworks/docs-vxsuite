# VxScan Setup

VxScan consists of two rigid tamper-evident bags - an inner ballot bag and an outer bag containing the ballot bag and the scanning technology:

For transport, the ballot bag is normally placed inside the scanner bag. It may be rolled like a suitcase:

### Opening the Outer Bag

Begin by placing the VxScan on a table. Break the seal and record the seal number in the **Equipment Seals Log.**

Unzip the top compartment.

### Powering On

Remove the power cord from the lid's pocket and plug it into an outlet. The screen will automatically boot up.

Lift the screen up so it is facing forward.\

### Attaching the Tray

VxScan uses an attachable tray to make it easier for voters to insert their ballots. The tray is typically on top of the scanner bag for transport, as in the pictures above.

Open the front flap. Push the flap down so it stays flat against the front of the scanner. The tray attaches via posts and magnets. With both hands, align the tray so that the plastic posts fit into the sides of the ballot opening until you feel the magnets snap in place.&#x20;

### Securing the Ballot Bag

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your jurisdiction may secure the ballot bag before the equipment reaches the precinct. In that case, your ballot bag will already be sealed as in the picture below and you are already done with setup.&#x20;

In order to secure the ballot bag in place as pictured above:

1. Remove the ballot bag from the outer bag
2. Open the front flap of the ballot bag
3. Put the ballot bag back into the outer bag
4. Place the metal ovals of the outer bag over the metal loops
5. Secure with two seals, one on each side
