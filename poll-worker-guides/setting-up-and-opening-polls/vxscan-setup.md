# VxScan Setup

## Hardware Overview

**VxScan** is in a tamper-evident blue container that may be rolled like a suitcase. Inside is an additional tamper-evident blue container used to store scanned ballots.

## VxScan Setup

The **VxScan** should be setup on it's own table and the table should be located somewhere between the privacy booths and the exit to the polling place.\
\
**VxScan** can be set up through the following steps:

1. **Open the container and plug it in:**
   * [ ] break the seal and record the seal number in the **Equipment Seals Log**
   * [ ] unzip the top compartment
   * [ ] remove the power cord from the lid pocket and plug it into an outlet

2\. **Prepare the scanner:**

* [ ] lift the screen up so it is facing forward
* [ ] open the front flap and secure it to the velcro at the bottom of the container
* [ ] attach the tray by inserting the posts until you feel the magnets snap in place
