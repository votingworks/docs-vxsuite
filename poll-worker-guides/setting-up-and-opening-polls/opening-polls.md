# Opening Polls

### Opening Polls on VxScan

After VxScan is initially turned on, it will show the Polls Closed screen.

If there is an orange banner that says "Testing Mode" on the screen, contact your election administrator immediately to prepare the machine for the election.
{% endhint %}

To open the polls, a poll worker must insert their Poll Worker Card into the card reader behind the screen. The front of the Poll Worker Card must be facing away from the screen. To open the polls, select _`Yes, Open the Polls`_.

Once complete, the screen will say Polls are open. As the polls were opening, the Open Polls Report was saved to the Poll Worker Card. The **** Open Polls Report should show that no ballots have been scanned. This will also serve as the precinct's Zero Report. Take the Poll Worker Card to VxMark to print.
