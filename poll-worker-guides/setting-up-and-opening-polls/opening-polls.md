# Opening Polls

### Opening Polls on VxScan

After VxScan is initially turned on, it will show the Polls Closed screen:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (180).png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If there is an orange banner that says "Testing Mode" on the screen, contact your election administrator immediately to prepare the machine for the election.
{% endhint %}

To open the polls, a poll worker must insert their Poll Worker card into the card reader behind the screen. The front of the Poll Worker card must be facing away from the screen. On the Poll Worker screen that appears, tap `Open Polls for [Precinct Name]`&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (152).png>)

Then confirm `Save Report and Open Polls`:

A **Open Polls Report** is saved to the Poll Worker card which should show that no ballots have been scanned. This will also serve as the precinct's **Zero Report**.&#x20;

### Printing the Open Polls Report

To print the report, insert the Poll Worker card into the **VxMark**'s card reader. On the VxMark's Poll Worker screen that appears, tap `Print Tally Report` :&#x20;

Two copies of the report will then be printed from the VxMark's printer. All contest totals should be zero. Below is an example of the polls open report:

### Opening Polls on VxMark

You need to separately open polls on the VxMark so it is ready for voting. With the poll worker card inserted, tap `Open Polls for [precinct name]`:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (127).png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If it says "Machine is in Testing Mode" on the VxMark poll worker screen, contact your election administrators immediately to prepare the machine for the election.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
