# VxMark Setup

The VxMark ballot marking device gives voters the ability to mark their choices and print their ballot from a touchscreen.

VxMark can be set up in just a couple of minutes. Before you start, confirm that you have the black VxMark case, its associated printer, and enough table space to comfortably fit both. &#x20;

### Place Equipment on Table

You can place the printer to the left or right of the black case:

### Set Up Printer

Connect the printer to power by connecting the plugging one end of the power cable into an outlet and the other end into the back of the printer. Turn the printer on by pressing the power button on the front in the top-right corner:

### Unpack VxMark

Pop open the black case by lifting the latches on the side and front. Within the case you'll see the touchscreen and, around it, the different components of the VxMark:&#x20;

1. **Headphones** in the travel pouch on top of the screen. Remove the pouch and set it aside for now.
2. **Accessible Controller** in the lower-left compartment. Remove it and set it beside the case to the left.
3. **Power Adapter** in the upper-left compartment. Remove the adapter and plug it into an outlet.
4. **Printer USB Cable** in the mid-right compartment. Connect this to the back of the printer.
5. **Card Reader** in the lower-right compartment. Leave this alone, it stays put.

#### Set Up the Privacy Shield

Behind the top layer of foam there is a privacy shield. Remove the privacy shield, set it up around the touchscreen, and replace the top foam. You can route the cables through the back corners of the privacy shield:

Remove the headphones and plug them into the audio outlet on the accessible controller:

You can place the empty travel pouch behind the privacy shield.

### Turning On VxMark

The power button is located in the middle-right compartment next to the printer cable. To find it, run your finger along the side of the screen. Press the power button firmly for 1 second and then release. You should see the card reader and accessible controller light up within 3-5 seconds:

You are done setting up the VxMark and are ready, when necessary, to open the polls and print the polls opened report.
