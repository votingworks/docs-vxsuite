# Securing Results and Packing Up VxScan

### Sealing the Ballot Bag

Before you can remove the USB drive that contains results, you will need to remove the ballot bag. Begin by breaking the seals securing the ballot bag:

After breaking the seals you can remove the ballot bag:

Close and the front flap on the ballot bag. You may seal it by passing a seal through the zippers and the metal circle:\

Record the seal number on the **Equipment Seals Log**.

### Removing USB Drive

With the ballot bag removed, you can now open the scanner compartment by lifting the latches on each side:

Find the USB drive in the center and pull it out:

After you have removed the USB Drive, make sure you close the metal enclosure.&#x20;

## Cleaning Up

The ballot bag should already be sealed but the scanner bag still needs to be packed and sealed. To do so:

1. Turn off the scanner by pressing the power button behind the screen
2. Lower the screen so it lies flat
3. Unplug the power cord and fold it to fit inside the lid pocket
4. Remove the feeder tray and place it at the bottom of the bag

At this point, VxScan should look like the following:

You can now begin sealing VxScan. Bring the zippers for the top compartment and the ballot entry flap all together at the front of the container. Place one seal through the metals rings.

Record the seal number on the **Equipment Seals Log** and store or return the equipment according to your election administrator's directions.
