# Packing Up VxMark

Use these instructions to pack up the VxMark Ballot Marking Device after the polls have closed.

### Turn Off VxMark

The power button is located in the middle-right compartment next to the printer cable. To find it, run your finger along the side of the screen. Press the power button firmly for 1 second and then release. You should see the screen change as the machine starts to shut down.

### Pack Up VxMark

#### **Headphones**

Unplug the headphones from the accessible controller. Place the headphones into the travel pouch.

#### Privacy Shield

The privacy shield will be stored back behind the top foam layer. Set the top foam aside. Lift the privacy shield up, fold it, and place it in the top lid. You can then put the top foam back in place, covering the privacy shield:
