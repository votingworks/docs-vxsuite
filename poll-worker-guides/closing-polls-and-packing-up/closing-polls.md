# Closing Polls

### Closing Polls on VxScan

To close the polls on VxScan, a poll worker must insert their Poll Worker Card into the card reader. The card must be facing away from the screen. Select _`Close Polls for [Precinct Name].`_

A Close Polls Report is saved to the Poll Worker Card which includes the number of ballots scanned and the tabulated results of those ballots. Take the Poll Worker Card to VxMark to print.
