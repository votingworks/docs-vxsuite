# Configure VxMark

Configuring VxMark requires an **Admin** **Card** - see[ Smart Cards](programming-cards.md) for information on how to program Admin Cards for your election.

First, turn on your VxMark. You should see the following screen:

Simply insert your Admin Card into the card reader and you should see the following screen:

Tap the `Load Election Definition` and, within a few seconds, you should see the Admin screen:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (98).png>)

Tap the Precinct drop-down menu and configure this VxMark for a specific precinct:

Your VxMark is now configured! You should be in `Testing Mode`. In `Testing Mode`, the VxMark will operate exactly as it does in "Live Election Mode" except:

* All ballots printed will be test ballots that cannot be tabulated alongside live ballots
* The starting screen and the Admin screen will indicate `Testing Mode`

Remove the Admin Card, and your VxMark is ready for L\&A testing:
