# Configure VxMark

Configuring VxMark requires an Admin Card - see[ Smart Cards](programming-cards.md) for information on how to program Admin Cards for your election.

Turn the VxMark on. Device Not Configured will be displayed on the screen.

Select the precinct drop-down menu and select the precinct the VxMark will be used in.

Your VxMark is now configured. The VxMark will be in Testing Mode. In Testing Mode, the VxMark will operate exactly as it does in Live Election Mode except:

* All ballots printed will be test ballots that cannot be tabulated alongside live ballots
* The starting screen and the Admin screen will indicate Testing Mode in an orange box

Remove the Admin Card and your VxMark is ready for L\&A testing.
