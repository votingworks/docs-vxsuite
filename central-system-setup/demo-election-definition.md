# Demo Election Definition

VxAdmin has a demo election definition built in to provide election administrators an election that is more practice and demonstration friendly.  Use the demo election to:

* practice various Election Manager functions
* provide poll workers with a training election
* provide voters an opportunity to try the equipment before Election Day.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: the demo election should not be configured after a live election has been configured.  If using this election for poll worker or voter training be sure to create [Smartcards](../hardware-setup/programming-cards.md), save the [Ballot Package](save-ballot-package.md), and print [Ballots](ballots.md) before configuring a live election.
{% endhint %}

To configure VxAdmin with the demo election, select _`Load Demo Election Definition`_ from the Configure VxAdmin screen.
