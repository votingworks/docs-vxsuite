# Export Ballot Package

## Export Ballot Package

To configure VxCentralScan and VxScan you must first export the ballot package from VxAdmin to a USB drive. Navigate to the Ballots tab in VxAdmin and select _`Export Ballot Package.`_

You will be prompted to insert a USB drive. Once you insert a USB drive, the screen updates and prompts you to export the ballot package. Select _`Export`_.

VxAdmin will generate the ballot package of all ballot styles, saving it automatically on the USB drive. You don't need to worry about the exact file location, but if you do want to look for it later, the file will be saved inside the ballot-packages directory.

Once the file is saved, VxAdmin prompts you to eject the USB drive. Select _`Eject USB`_.

After a few seconds, it is safe to remove the USB drive.
