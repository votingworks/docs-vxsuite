# Export Ballot Package

## Export Ballot Package

To configure **VxCentralScan** and **VxScan** you must first export the ballot package from **VxAdmin** to a USB drive. Navigate to the `Ballots` tab in VxAdmin and click `Export Ballot Package`:

You will be prompted to insert a USB drive:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Parallels Picture 14.png>)

Once you insert a USB drive, the screen updates and prompts you to export the ballot package:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Parallels Picture 15.png>)

Click `Export` and VxAdmin will generate the ballot package of all ballot styles, saving it automatically on the USB drive:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (175).png>)

You don't need to worry about the exact file location, but if you do want to look for it later, the file will be saved inside the `ballot-packages` directory.

Once the file is saved, VxAdmin lets you know and prompts you to eject the USB drive:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (190).png>)

After a few seconds, you can pull out the USB drive.
