# VxAdmin Hardware Setup

### Hardware Overview

**VxAdmin** is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) laptop pre-installed with VotingWorks software and an HP printer. All USB flash drives, cords, adapters, and programmable smart cards needed to operate the system are included and stored in an orange case.

### Recommended and Compatible Paper

We recommend using 28 lb letter paper (8.5" x 11"), specifically the following:

* Election Day ballots, white paper - [Hammermill 102450](https://www.amazon.com/Hammermill-Premium-Letter-Bright-102450C/dp/B00006IDP3/)
* Absentee ballots, canary yellow paper - [Springhill 024159R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WW39DGN/)

You may also use 24 lb or 32 lb paper. **Do not use paper thinner than 24 lb.** Thinner paper is somewhat transparent, and marks from one side of the ballot show through the paper and interfere with scanning of the opposite side.

### HP Printer FAQ

**Do we need to install toner?**

New printers come with toner installed by default. The display will alert you when the toner level becomes low, at which point please follow [HP's instructions](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06392751) to replace it.

**The printer displays "Select Language" and won't print. What do I do?**

The first time a printer is used or if it is ever reset, it must be configured by responding to the on-screen prompts. You can simply press the "OK" button repeatedly, selecting all the defaults, until it says "Ready."

**How do I fix streaks, lines, or otherwise poor print quality?**

Print a "Cleaning Page." In order to do so, navigate through the following options on the printer LCD screen:

1. Setup
2. Printer Maintenance
3. Print Quality Tools
4. Cleaning Page

Printing the cleaning page will usually clear the printer's rollers of stray ink that is causing print issues.&#x20;

**What if printing a "Cleaning Page" helps, but the issue keeps coming back?**

If you are not using the recommended paper, it's possible that the paper you are using is not compatible with the printer. When toner doesn't print properly to a page, it can end up on the rollers where it will cause streaks on later pages. Try printing another cleaning page and then using a [recommended paper](vxadmin-hardware-setup.md#recommended-and-compatible-paper).

If you **are** using a recommended paper, the toner cartridge may be defective and may need to be replaced.
