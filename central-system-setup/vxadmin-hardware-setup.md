VotingWorks also provides the USB flash drives, cords, adapters, and programmable smart cards to operate the system. Besides the printer, all equipment is stored in an **Orange Apache 4800 Case**, which also contains the [VxBatch laptop](vxbatch-hardware-setup.md).

## Recommended and Compatible Paper

We recommend using 28 lb letter paper (8.5" x 11"), specifically the following:

* Election Day ballots, white paper - [Hammermill 102450](https://www.amazon.com/Hammermill-Premium-Letter-Bright-102450C/dp/B00006IDP3/)
* Absentee ballots, canary yellow paper - [Springhill 024159R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WW39DGN/)

You may also use 24 lb or 32 lb paper. **Do not use paper thinner than 24 lb.** Thinner paper is somewhat transparent, and marks from one side of the ballot show through the paper and interfere with scanning of the opposite side.

## HP Printer FAQ

**Do we need to install toner?**

New printers come with toner installed by default. The display will alert you when the toner level becomes low, at which point please follow [HP's instructions](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06392751) to replace it.

**The printer displays "Select Language" and won't print. What do I do?**

The first time a printer is used or if it is ever reset, it must be configured by responding to the on-screen prompts. You can simply press the "OK" button repeatedly, selecting all the defaults, until it says "Ready."
