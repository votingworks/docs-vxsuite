Then review each contest's data by selecting a contest button. Carefully review the contest to ensure all of the candidates are included, their party labels are correct (if applicable), and their names are spelled correctly.

### The All Contests Ballot

One ballot in this view provides a look at all contests across all ballot styles on one ballot. For example, if a county has five county commission districts, this ballot will show each contest on one ballot.  It should only be used for display or ballot proofing. It's Precinct and Ballot Styles are listed as All in the list of ballots.

## Edit Election Definition

If you find any errors while proofing the definition or ballots, you have one of two options.

**If you imported directly from SEMS,** you should make changes directly in SEMS, re-export the SEMS files, and then re-configure VxAdmin with the new SEMS files. It's necessary to make edits in SEMS first so that the two systems match when you send files to SEMS at the end of an election.

**If you imported a VotingWorks-provided definition file,** please reach out to VotingWorks for help editing the election definition.
