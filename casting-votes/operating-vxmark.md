# VxMark Poll Worker Guide

If you have not already set up and turned on the VxMark, follow the instructions to do so:

{% content-ref url="../hardware-setup/vxmark.md" %}
[vxmark.md](../hardware-setup/vxmark.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Connecting the Printer

If the printer is not both turned on and connected, the screen will display **No Printer Connected**. Make sure the printer is connected. You may need to unplug the USB cord and plug it back in once or twice, and the VxMark unit will take 3-5 seconds to detect the printer.

## Opening Polls

Once the VxMark unit is turned on and connected to the printer, the Polls Closed screen should appear:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2021-05-21 15-54-57.png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The screen should **NOT** display an orange **testing mode** banner, and the polls should be closed.
{% endhint %}

Insert the Poll Worker card, and you should see the Poll Worker screen:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (53).png>)

Tap `Open Polls for [precinct name]`:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png>)

Confirm your decision by tapping `Yes`. The polls-open report should begin printing:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2021-05-21 15-56-13.png>)

At this point, remove the Poll Worker card and keep it close.

## Activating VxMark for a Voter

When a voter is ready to vote, it's time to activate the VxMark for the appropriate ballot style. The screen should initially display:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2021-05-21 15-56-32.png>)

Insert the Poll Worker card, and the Poll Worker screen comes up, displaying all available ballot styles for this precinct under the **Activate Ballot Style **heading:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (55).png>)

Tap the desired ballot style, and the screen changes to indicate that the VxMark has been activated with that ballot style:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Parallels Picture 38 (1).png>)

Take out the Poll Worker card and let the voter know they can begin voting by tapping the Start Voting button:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)

## Voting

The voter can move forward and backwards through the contests at will:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Parallels Picture 41.png>)

At the end of all contests, a **Review Your Votes **screen appears

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Parallels Picture 43.png>)

The voter may change their selection for any of the contests, then tap `I'm Ready to Print My Ballot` when they're done. The ballot should then begin printing, as the screen indicates:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Parallels Picture 44.png>)

The screen then lets the voter know how to cast their printed ballot:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Parallels Picture 45.png>)

The voter may press the `Done` button if they wish, but it's not required. The screen will automatically refresh to the starting point after a few seconds.

## Closing the Polls

When the polls are ready to be closed, insert the Poll Worker card and tap `Close Polls`:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (56).png>)

Confirm the action by tapping `Yes`:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (57).png>)

The polls-closed report will begin printing:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2021-05-21 16-01-18.png>)

Multiple copies of a Polls Closed report will print.

## Combined Results Reports

When there are multiple VxMarks in the same precinct, you can combine the results from each machine into a single polls-closed report. In order to combine the results, you will save each VxMark's results to the Poll Worker card.&#x20;

At each VxMark, one at a time, insert the Poll Worker card to display the poll worker screen. Under the **Combined Results Reports **header, tap `Save to Card` :

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png>)

It will take a moment to save the results to the card:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2021-05-21 16-01-55.png>)

In the list next to the VxMark's ID, you will now see the time and date that the results were saved to the card:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (59).png>)

Save the results from every VxMark to the card. At the final VxMark, tap `Print Combined Report for [number] Machines` :

![Note: The results of the current machine will be included whether they are saved to the card or not](<../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png>)

Confirm the action by tapping `Print Report` :

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png>)

The combined polls-closed report will begin printing:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2021-05-21 16-10-48.png>)

Two copies of the combined polls-closed report will print. They are the same format as the individual VxMark polls-closed reports, but include the results and ballot counts of multiple machines:
