Once you insert a USB drive with CVRs, you should automatically see the CVR files you may load. Select _`Load`_ next to the file you want.

When loaded, confirm that the presented file name, count and precinct(s) are as expected. You may also review the ballot count by precinct and view any unofficial tally reports in the Reports tab.

## Compare Results

Compare the expected test deck results report to the tally report. These reports should match exactly unless only using VxCentralScan and the hand-marked test ballots. If desired, you may also manually tally the test deck ballots and check that manual tally against the scanned results.
