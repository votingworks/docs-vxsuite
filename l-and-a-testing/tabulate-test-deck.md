## Compare Results

Compare the expected test deck results report to the tally report. These reports should match exactly if only using VxCentralScan.  If using VxCentralScan + VxScan + VxMark, the totals will be four times the expected test deck result. If desired, you may also manually tally the test deck ballots and check that manual tally against the scanned results.
