# Tally Test Results

Before tallying, insert the USB drive used to save the test deck CVR file into VxAdmin. All tabulation functionality in VxAdmin is available within the `Tally` tab.

The following should be repeated for each CVR file saved from either VxScan or VxCentralScan. If using BMDs, there should be two CVR files per scanner. If using only hand-marked paper ballots, there should be one CVR file per scanner.

## Import CVR

First click `Tally` to access the tally tab and then click `Import CVR Files`.&#x20;

When imported, confirm that the presented file name, count and precinct(s) are as expected. You may also review the ballot count by precinct and view any unofficial tally reports as desired.

Before printing the report, you can preview it on screen by tapping the `Preview Report` button.

## Compare Results

Compare the expected test deck results report to the tally report. These reports should match exactly. If desired, you may also manually tally the test deck ballots and check that manual tally against the scanned results.
