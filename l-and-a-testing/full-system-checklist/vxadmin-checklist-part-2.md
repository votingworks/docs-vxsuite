# VxAdmin Checklist - Part 2

You've already printed test decks, scanned them, and saved their results as CVR files. In this final step, we combine all the CVR files from VxScan and VxCentralScan to confirm the results are correct.&#x20;

| Name | Date |
| ---- | ---- |

For **every** USB drive:

* [ ] Insert USB drive with the CVR file
* [ ] Select _`Load CVR Files`_ under the Tally tab
* [ ] Load the CVR file
* [ ] Eject USB drive

After all files are loaded:

* [ ] Print the _`Unofficial Full Election Tally`_
* [ ] Confirm that the tallies match
* [ ] Remove CVR files
