# VxAdmin Checklist - Part 2

You've already printed test decks, scanned them, and exported their results as CVR files. In this final step, we inspect each of the CVR files to confirm they are correct. You should have two CVR files for every VxScan and two CVR files for every VxBatch.

Repeat the following checklist **for every CVR file**.&#x20;

| Name | Date |
| ---- | ---- |

* [ ] Insert USB drive with the CVR file
* [ ] Confirm that the count of ballots in VxAdmin matches the size of the CVR's test deck
* [ ] Print Unofficial Full Election Tally Report
* [ ] Confirm that it matches the Test Ballot Deck Tally for the CVR's test deck
* [ ] Clear CVR files
