# VxAdmin Checklist - Part 2

You've already printed test decks, scanned them, and exported their results as CVR files. In this final step, we combine all the CVR files from VxScan and VxCentralScan to confirm the results are correct.&#x20;

| Name | Date |
| ---- | ---- |

For **every** USB drive:

* [ ] Insert USB drive with the CVR file
* [ ] Select _`Import CVR Files`_ under the Tally tab
* [ ] Import the CVR file
* [ ] Eject USB drive

After all files are imported:

* [ ] Print the _`Unofficial Full Election Tally`_
* [ ] Confirm that the tallies are **four times** the Test Ballot Deck Tally
* [ ] Clear CVR files
