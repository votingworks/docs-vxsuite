# VxAdmin Checklist - Part 1

This checklist needs to be run only once for the entire jurisdiction. Its purpose is to print materials used for later stages of L\&A. Some sections **** only apply to jurisdictions using VxScan, and are labelled "**VxScan Users Only**." For help with these steps, see [Printing VxAdmin Test Materials](../test-deck-printing.md).
