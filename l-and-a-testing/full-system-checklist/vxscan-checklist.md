# VxScan Checklist

The VxScan Checklist should be run for _each _VxScan. You will need Admin and Poll Worker Cards.  If your VxScan unit is not yet set up or configured for a particular precinct, see [VxScan Hardware Setup](broken-reference).

Before beginning the VxScan part of L\&A, you'll want to split up and reorganize the test ballots by precinct: the VxAdmin test deck, the VxMark test deck, and the additional blank and overvoted ballots.
