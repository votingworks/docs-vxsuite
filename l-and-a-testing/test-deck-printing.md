# Print VxAdmin Test Materials

## Print Test Deck

To print the test deck of test ballots, first click the `Tally` tab and then click `Print Test Decks`:

![Print Test Decks](<../.gitbook/assets/image (66).png>)

In the **Test Deck **view, a list of precincts available for the election will appear. Click the name of the precinct you would like to print a test deck for or click `All Precincts` for the entire county. VotingWorks recommends to print one precinct at a time (in alphabetical order) given the large size of test decks:

Confirm the election and precinct information and click `Print Test Deck`. If you are printing test decks for all precincts, VxAdmin will show the status of the printing by precinct:

When printed, you can set aside the results report until test deck tabulation.

## Print Zero Report

Before scanning the test deck, you'll first confirm that the Election Manager does not have any ballot results loaded by visiting the `Tally` tab. In this view, you'll be presented a **Ballot Count by Precinct **report which should read `0` for all precincts and the Total Ballot Count. To print a confirmed zero report, click `View Unofficial Full Election Tally` and then the green `Print Report` button in the subsequent screen:
