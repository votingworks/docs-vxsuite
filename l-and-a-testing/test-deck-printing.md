# Print VxAdmin Test Materials

## Print Zero Report

Before starting the testing process, confirm VxAdmin does not have CVRs loaded. Go to the Reports tab and review the ballot counts. They should all be zero. To print a confirmed zero report, select _`Unofficial Full Election Tally.`_

Each L\&A Package will print:

* Precinct Tally Report (expected results of the precinct)
* Pre-voted VxMark test ballots
* Pre-voted hand-marked test ballots
* Two blank hand-marked test ballots (one remains blank, one is hand-marked by an election official to replace a pre-voted hand-marked test ballot)
* One overvoted hand-marked test ballot

## Print Full Test Deck Tally Report

The Full Test Deck Tally Report is the results we expect after scanning all test decks through all systems (VxScan and VxCentralScan). To print the Full Test Deck Tally Report, go to the L\&A tab and  select _`Print Full Test Deck Tally Report.`_
