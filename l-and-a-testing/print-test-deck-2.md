# Print VxMark Test Decks

The VxMark test deck can be printed at any VxMark unit.

Before printing, first make sure you have configured a VxMark unit. If you're not sure how to configure the VxMark, see [VxMark: Configuration](../hardware-setup/configuring-and-operating-vxmark.md).

Turn on your VxMark and insert the Admin Card. The Admin screen should come up. Verify the election ID in the lower-left-hand corner, and that you're in testing mode:

Tap `View Test Ballot Decks`, which then shows you a list of Test Ballot Decks.

You can select `All Precincts` or choose a precinct, which then leads to the following screen.

The number of ballots depends on your number of precincts and ballot styles. Tap `Print ... ballots` and the test deck will then print. Depending on your number of ballots, this may take a few minutes.

You now have a test deck of BMD ballots ready to scan.
