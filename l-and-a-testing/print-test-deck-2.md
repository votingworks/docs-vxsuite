# Print VxMark Test Decks

The VxMark test deck can be printed at any VxMark unit. The [VxMark must be configured](../hardware-setup/configuring-and-operating-vxmark.md) to complete this step.

To print the VxMark test deck:

* [ ] turn the VxMark on&#x20;
* [ ] insert the Admin Card
* [ ] verify the election ID in the lower-left-hand corner
* [ ] verify you are in testing mode

After a selection is made, select _`Print n ballots`_ to print the test deck. The number of ballots varies based on the number of contests and candidates on the ballot.
