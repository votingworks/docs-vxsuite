# L\&A Overview

Logic & Accuracy testing is meant to ensure that every component of the voting system is operating as expected and has been configured properly for a specific upcoming election.

To perform logic & accuracy testing, you will need all the election equipment that you will or might use in the upcoming election, including peripherals like printers and scanners.

The length and complexity of L\&A depends on how many different components of VxSuite you are using. If you are only using VxAdmin and VxBatch, then use the shorter [Central System Checklist.](election-manager-and-ballot-scanner-checklist.md) If you're using any precinct equipment (VxMark or VxScan), then use the [Full System Checklist](full-system-checklist/).
