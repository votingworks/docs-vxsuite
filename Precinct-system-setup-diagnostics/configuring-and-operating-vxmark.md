# Configure VxMark

Configuring VxMark requires an Election Manager Card - see[ Smartcards](../hardware-setup/programming-cards.md) for information on how to program Election Manager Cards for your election.

Turn the VxMark on. VxMark is Not Configured will be displayed on the screen.

Insert your Election Manager Card into the card reader and select _`Load Election Definition`_.

When complete, the Election Manager Actions screen will be displayed. Select the precinct drop-down menu and select the precinct the VxMark will be used in.

Your VxMark is now configured. The VxMark will be in Testing Mode. In Testing Mode, the VxMark will operate exactly as it does in Live Election Mode except:

* All ballots printed will be test ballots that cannot be tabulated alongside live ballots
* The starting screen and the Election Manager Actions screen will indicate Testing Mode in an orange box

Remove the Election Manager Card and your VxMark is ready for L\&A testing.
