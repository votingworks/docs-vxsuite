&#x20;\*Note: VxScan will notify the poll worker that the ballot bag is full at 700 voters. However, the ballot bag may be emptied or replaced earlier by inserting a Poll Worker Card and selecting _`Replace Ballot Bag`_. Once the ballot bag has been emptied or replaced, select _`Yes, Resume Voting`_ and remove the Poll Worker Card.
