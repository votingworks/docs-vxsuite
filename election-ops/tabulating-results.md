# Tally Results

## Tallying CVRs

All tabulation functionality in VxAdmin is available within the Tally tab. Select the Tally tab and then select _`Load CVR Files.`_

To tally results, each USB drive from the precincts and VxCentralScan must be imported. One at a time, insert the USB drives. A dialog box will pop up and show you each CVR file saved on the USB drive. Select _`Load`_ next to the file (live election, correct number of ballots, correct time) you'd like to import.

When imported, confirm that the presented file name, CVR count, and precinct(s) are as expected. Load CVR files from all of your scanners, VxScan and VxCentralScan. To review the ballot count by precinct and view any unofficial tally reports desired, go to the Reports tab.&#x20;

## Separating Absentee from Precinct

You can also print a tabulation report of just the precinct ballots, or just the absentee ballots under Tally Report by Voting Method.

### Full Results File

A results file may also be saved that contains all of the vote totals separated by contest, candidate, precinct, and vote type in a .csv file format. This allows for custom report creation and/or additional analysis of the election data.  To save the results in .csv format, go to the Reports tab and select _`Save Results.`_

The .cvs file can be opened in any spreadsheet software program and will display the following information. The ID fields (Contest, Selection, etc.) are internal identification numbers.
