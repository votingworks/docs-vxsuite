# Tally Results

## Exporting Cast Vote Records (CVRs)

When all ballot batches (including any duplicated ballots) have been scanned, you will need to export the CVRs from VxCentralScan to load into VxAdmin for tabulation.

To export, click `Export` in the top right.

You'll be prompted to insert a USB stick. Once recognized, click "Export" again:

You don't need to worry about filenames. The export process takes care of that.

Once you've clicked "Export", you'll see a confirmation screen, where you can click "Eject USB":

Then, you can physically remove the USB stick that now holds the CVR file.

If using multiple VxCentralScan stations, repeat for each one

### Export Backup

After exporting the CVR, VotingWorks recommends also taking a backup of all data from the VxCentralScan station. To export a backup, navigate to the `Admin` view and then click `Export Backup`. You will then navigate to the USB drive in the file dialog and save the backup `.zip` file. The file may take up to a few minutes to save.

Once saved, click `Eject USB` and remove the USB drive from VxCentralScan.

## Tallying CVRs

All tabulation functionality in VxAdmin is available within the **Tally** tab. Click `Tally` to access the tally tab and then click `Import CVR Files`:

To tally results, each USB stick from the precincts and VxCentralScan must be imported. One at a time, insert the USB sticks. A dialog box will pop up and show you each CVR file saved on the USB Drive. Select the right file (live election, correct number of ballots, correct time.)

When imported, confirm that the presented file name, CVR count, and precinct(s) are as expected. You may also review the ballot count by precinct and view any unofficial tally reports as desired. Import CVR files from all of your scanners, VxScan and VxCentralScan.

After importing your CVR file(s), scroll to the **Unofficial Tally Reports** and click `View Unofficial Full Election Tally Report`.&#x20;

Click `Print Report` to print results, `Preview Report` to view the report on screen, or `Save Report as PDF` to save the election tally to a USB drive.

The printed report should look like the image below with the election name and the VotingWorks logo:
