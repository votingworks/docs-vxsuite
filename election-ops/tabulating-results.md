# Tally Results

## Exporting Cast Vote Records (CVRs)

When all ballot batches (including any duplicated ballots) have been scanned, you will need to export the CVRs from VxBatch to load into VxAdmin for tabulation.

To export, click `Export` in the top right.

You'll be prompted to insert a USB stick. Once recognized, click "Export" again:

You don't need to worry about filenames. The export process takes care of that.

Once you've clicked "Export", you'll see a confirmation screen, where you can click "Eject USB":

Then, you can physically remove the USB stick that now holds the CVR file.

If using multiple VxBatch units, repeat for each one

### Export Backup

After exporting the CVR, VotingWorks recommends also taking a backup of all data from the VxBatch. To export a backup, navigate to the `Advanced` view and then click `Export Backup`. You will then navigate to the USB drive in the file dialog and save the backup `.zip` file. The file may take up to a few minutes to save.

Once saved, click `Eject USB` and remove the USB drive from VxBatch.

## Tallying CVRs

All tabulation functionality in VxAdmin is available within the **Tally** tab. Click `Tally` to access the tally tab and then click `Import CVR Files`:

You'll be prompted to insert a USB stick if you haven't already. The dialog will show you all CVR files saved on the USB Drive. Select the right file (live election, correct number of ballots, correct time.)

When imported, confirm that the presented file name, CVR count, and precinct(s) are as expected. You may also review the ballot count by precinct and view any unofficial tally reports as desired. Import CVR files from all of your scanners, VxScan and VxBatch.&#x20;
