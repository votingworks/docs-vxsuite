### Recommended and Compatible Paper

We recommend using 28 lb letter paper (8.5" x 11"), specifically the following:

* Election Day ballots, white paper - [Hammermill 102450](https://www.amazon.com/Hammermill-Premium-Letter-Bright-102450C/dp/B00006IDP3/)
* Absentee ballots, canary yellow paper - [Springhill 024159R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WW39DGN/)

You may also use 24 lb or 32 lb paper. **Do not use paper thinner than 24 lb.** Thinner paper is somewhat transparent, and marks from one side of the ballot show through the paper and interfere with scanning of the opposite side.
