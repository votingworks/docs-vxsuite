# Supply List

### Paper Recommendations and Compatibility

We recommend using 28lb or heavier letter paper (8.5" x 11"). Specifically:

* Election Day ballots, white paper - [Hammermill 102450](https://www.amazon.com/Hammermill-Premium-Letter-Bright-102450C/dp/B00006IDP3/)
* Absentee ballots, canary yellow paper - [Springhill 024159R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WW39DGN/)

**Do not use paper thinner than 28 lb.** Significantly thinner paper is somewhat transparent, and marks from one side of the ballot show through the paper and interfere with scanning of the opposite side.

### Toner Cartridges

The HP printers for both VxMark and VxAdmin use toner cartridge 58. HP offers two sizes:

* [HP 58A](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-58a-black-original-laserjet-toner-cartridge) - regular size, prints approximately 3000 pages
* [HP 58X](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-58x-high-yield-black-original-laserjet-toner-cartridge) - high yield, prints approximately 10000 pages

### USB Drive Recommendations and Compatibility

While our system does not require a particular type of USB drive, some USB drives will not work because of how they are formatted.&#x20;

There are a handful of USB drive models that we have tested and recommend to customers. We selected them because they work with our system, have reputable manufacturers, and can be bought at a reasonable price. You don't need more than 8GB in size, but for most of our recommended models the minimum you can buy is 16GB.
